Learning Rate\n  - Description: Controls the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum of the loss function.\n  - Tuning: Start with a moderate value (e.g., 0.001), use learning rate schedules (e.g., step decay, exponential decay).\n\n2. Batch Size\n  - Description: Number of samples processed before the model is updated.\n  - Tuning: Common values range from 32 to 256. Larger batches require more memory but can leverage better parallelism.\n\n4. Number of Epochs\n  - Description: Number of complete passes through the training dataset.\n  - Tuning: Monitor validation loss to avoid overfitting, typically between 10 to 100 epochs.\n\n5. Optimizer\n  - Popular Choices: SGD, Adam, RMSprop.\n  - Tuning: Adam is a good default choice; try SGD with momentum for potentially better convergence.\n\n6. Regularization Parameters\n  - Weight Decay (L2 Regularization): Penalizes large weights, reducing overfitting.\n  - Dropout Rate: Randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training, preventing overfitting.\n\n## Loss Functions\n\n1. Cross-Entropy Loss\n  - Description: Measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n  - Use Case: Standard for multi-class classification problems.\n\n2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n  - Description: Measures the average of the squares of the errors between predicted and actual values.\n  - Use Case: More common in regression, but sometimes used in classification problems with continuous labels.\n\n4. Categorical Hinge Loss\n  - Description: Measures the performance for \"one-versus-all\" classification tasks.\n  - Use Case: Useful in scenarios with class imbalance.\n\n5. Focal Loss\n  - Description: Modifies cross-entropy loss to address class imbalance by down-weighting the loss assigned to well-classified examples.\n  - Use Case: Effective in highly imbalanced datasets.\n\n### Other Important Topics\n\n- Data Augmentation\n  - Description: Techniques to artificially increase the size of a dataset by creating modified versions of images.\n  - Methods: Rotation, flipping, scaling, cropping, color jittering.\n  - Use Case: Helps improve model generalization.\n\n- Transfer Learning\n  - Description: Using a pre-trained model on a new, but related task.\n  - Approach: Fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the new dataset.\n  - Use Case: Effective when the new dataset is small.\n\n- Evaluation Metrics\n  - Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.\n  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Useful for class imbalance scenarios.\n  - Confusion Matrix: Provides insight into the performance of the classification model on each class.\n\n- Model Interpretability\n  - Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping): Visualizes which parts of the image are important for the model’s predictions.\n  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Explains the output of machine learning models.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED!
